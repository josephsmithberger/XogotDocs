# Xogot User Interface

Navigating the Xogot UI

## User Interface

Xogot's UI has been adapted to better suit the iPad, including making parts of
the UI more tappable, and removing some parts of the user interface to economize
available real estate.  Many toolbar icons have been replaced with Apple's 
SF Symbols to better match the look and feel of iPadOS.  This document provides 
a guide to the layout and structure of Xogot's toolbars.

## Toolbar

Below is an overview of each element in the toolbar, along with a numbered
screenshot to help you locate each feature.

editor while the File Pad helps you manage the files in your project.

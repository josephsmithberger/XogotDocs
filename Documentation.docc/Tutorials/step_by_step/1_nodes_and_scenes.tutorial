            **Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of your game**. They are like the
            ingredients in a recipe. There are dozens of kinds that can display an image,
            play a sound, represent a camera, and much more.

            @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_nodes.png")
        }
        @ContentAndMedia {
        
            All nodes have the following characteristics:
                
            * A name.
            * Editable properties.
            * They receive callbacks to update every frame.
            * You can extend them with new properties and functions.
            * You can add them to another node as a child.

            The last characteristic is important. **Together, nodes form a tree**, which is a powerful
            feature to organize projects. Since different nodes have different functions,
            combining them produces more complex behavior. As we saw before, you can build a
            playable character the camera follows using a [`CharacterBody2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_CharacterBody2D.html#class-CharacterBody2D)
            node, a [`Sprite2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_Sprite2D.html#class-Sprite2D) node,
            a [`Camera2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_Camera2D.html#class-Camera2D) node, and a [`CollisionShape2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_CollisionShape2D.html#class-CollisionShape2D) node.

    }
    @Section(title: "Scenes") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            When you organize nodes in a tree, like our character, we call this construct a
            scene. Once saved, scenes work like new node types in the editor, where you can
            add them as a child of an existing node. In that case, the instance of the scene
            appears as a single node with its internals hidden.

            Scenes allow you to structure your game's code however you want. You can
            **compose nodes** to create custom and complex node types, like a game character
            that runs and jumps, a life bar, a chest with which you can interact, and more.

            @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_3d_scene_example.png")
        }
        @ContentAndMedia {
            The Godot editor essentially is a **scene editor**. It has plenty of tools for
            editing 2D and 3D scenes, as well as user interfaces. A Godot project can
            contain as many of these scenes as you need. The engine only requires one as
            your application's **main scene**. This is the scene Godot will first load when
            you or a player runs the game.

            On top of acting like nodes, scenes have the following characteristics:

            1. They always have one root node, like the "Player" in our example.
            2. You can save them to your local drive and load them later.
            3. You can create as many instances of a scene as you'd like. You could have
            five or ten characters in your game, created from your Character scene.
        }
    }
    @Section(title: "Creating your first scene") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            Let's create our first scene with a single node. To do so, you will need to
            [`create a new project`](doc:doc_creating_and_importing_projects) first. After
            opening the project, you should see an empty editor.

            @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_01_empty_editor.png")
        }
        @ContentAndMedia {
            In an empty scene, the Scene dock on the left shows several options to add a
            root node quickly: 
            * 2D Scene adds a [`Node2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_Node2D.html#class-Node2D) node
            * 3D Scene adds a [`Node3D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_Node3D.html#class-Node3D) node,
            * User Interface adds a [`Control`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_Control.html#class-Control) node
            
            These presets are here for convenience; they are not mandatory.
            Other Node lets you select any node to be the root node.
            
            In an empty scene, **Other Node** is equivalent to pressing the **Add Child Node** (+)
            button at the top-left of the Scene dock.
            }
        @Steps {
            We're going to add a single [`Label`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_Label.html#class-Label) node to our scene. Its function is to draw
            text on the screen.
            @Step {
                Press the **Add Child Node** button or **Other Node** to create a
                root node.
                @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_02_scene_dock.png")
            }
            @Step {
                The **Create New Node** dialog opens, showing an array of featured/commonly used nodes. To access the full list, press **All** in the tab bar and that will show the very long list of all available nodes.
                @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_03_create_node_window.png")
            }
            @Step {
                Select the `Label` node. 
                
                >Tip: You can also type its name to filter down the list in the **All** tab.
                @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_04_create_label_window.png")
            }
            @Step {
                Click on the `Label` node to select it and click the **Create** button at
                the bottom of the window.
                @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_05_editor_with_label.png")
            }
            @Step {
                A lot happens when you add a scene's first node. The scene changes to the 2D
                workspace because `Label` is a 2D node type. The `Label` appears, selected, in the
                top-left corner of the viewport. The node appears in the Scene dock on the left,
                and the node's properties appear in the **Scope** pane on the right if open. By default in a new Xogot project the **Scope** is closed. 
            }
            Let's open the **Scope** now and take a look at the available properties. We will edit them in the next section.
            @Step {
                Press the cross-hair icon in the top right to open the **Scope**.
            }
        }
    }
    @Section(title: "Changing a node's properties") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            The next step is to change the Label's Text property. Let's change
            it to "Hello World".

            Head to the Inspector dock on the right of the viewport. Click inside the field
            below the Text property and type "Hello World".

            @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_06_label_text.png")
        }
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                You will see the text draw in the viewport as you type.

                > See also: You can edit any property listed in the Inspector as we did with
                the Text. For a complete reference of the Inspector dock, see
                <doc:doc_editor_inspector_dock>.

                You can move your Label node in the viewport by selecting the move tool in the
                toolbar.
                @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_07_move_tool.png")
            }
            @Step {
                With the Label selected, click and drag anywhere in the viewport to
                move it to the center of the view delimited by the rectangle.
                @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_08_hello_world_text.png")
            }
        }
    }
    @Section(title: "Running the scene") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            Everything's ready to run the scene! Press the Run Current Scene
            button in the top-right of the screen or press F6 (Cmd + R on
            macOS).

            @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_09_play_scene_button.png")
        }
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                A popup invites you to save the scene, which is required to run it. Click the
                Save button in the file browser to save it as `label.tscn`.
                @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_10_save_scene_as.png")
            }
            @Step {
                > The Save Scene As dialog, like other file dialogs in the editor, only
                allows you to save files inside the project. The `res://` path at
                the top of the window represents the project's root directory and
                stands for "resource path". For more information about file paths in
                Godot, see <doc:doc_filesystem>.

                The application should open in a new window and display the text "Hello World".
                @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_11_final_result.png")
            }
            @Step {
                Close the window or press F8 (Cmd + . on macOS) to quit the running scene.
            }
        }
    }
    @Section(title: "Setting the main scene") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            To run our test scene, we used the Run Current Scene button. Another button
            next to it, Run Project, allows you to set and run the project's
            **main scene**. You can also press F5 (Cmd + B on macOS) to do so.

            @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_12_play_button.png")
        }
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                > Running the project's *main scene* is distinct from running the
                *current scene*. If you encounter unexpected behavior, check
                to ensure you are running the correct scene.

                A popup window appears and invites you to select the main scene.
                @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_13_main_scene_popup.png")
            }
            @Step {
                Click the Select button, and in the file dialog that appears, double
                click on `label.tscn`.
                @Image(source: "nodes_and_scenes_14_select_main_scene.png")
            }
            @Step {
                The demo should run again. Moving forward, every time you run the project, Godot
                will use this scene as a starting point.

                > The editor saves the main scene's path in a project.godot file in your
                project's directory. While you can edit this text file directly to
                change project settings, you can also use the Project > Project Settings
                window to do so. For more information, see <doc:doc_project_settings>.

                In the next part, we will discuss another key concept in games and in Godot:
                creating instances of a scene.
            }
        }
    }

            This lesson will give you an overview of the available scripting languages in
            Godot. You will learn the pros and cons of each option. In the next part, you
            will write your first script using GDScript.

            **Scripts attach to a node and extend its behavior**. This means that scripts
            inherit all functions and properties of the node they attach to.

            For example, take a game where a Camera2D node follows a ship. The Camera2D node
            follows its parent by default. Imagine you want the camera to shake when the player
            takes damage. As this feature is not built into Godot, you would attach a script
            to the Camera2D node and code the shake.

    @Section(title: "Available scripting languages") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            Godot offers **four gameplay programming languages**: GDScript, C#,
            and, via its GDExtension technology, C and C++. There are more
            community-supported languages, but these are the official ones.

            You can use multiple languages in a single project. For instance, in a team, you
            could code gameplay logic in GDScript as it's fast to write, and use C# or C++ to
            implement complex algorithms and maximize their performance. Or you can write
            everything in GDScript or C#. It's your call.

            We provide this flexibility to answer the needs of different game projects and
            developers.

    @Section(title: "Which language should I use?") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            If you're a beginner, we recommend to **start with GDScript**. We made this
            language specifically for Godot and the needs of game developers. It has a
            lightweight and straightforward syntax and provides the tightest integration
            with Godot.

            @Step {
                For C#, you will need an external code editor like
                [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or Visual Studio. While C# support is
                now mature, you will find fewer learning resources for it compared to
                GDScript. That's why we recommend C# mainly to users who already have experience
                with the language.

                Let's look at each language's features, as well as its pros and cons.

            <doc:GDScript<doc_gdscript>> is an
            [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and
            [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming)
            programming language built for Godot. It's made by and for game developers
            to save you time coding games. Its features include:

            * A simple syntax that leads to short files.
            * Blazing fast compilation and loading times.
            * Tight editor integration, with code completion for nodes, signals, and more
            information from the scene it's attached to.
            * Built-in vector and transform types, making it efficient for heavy use of
            linear algebra, a must for games.
            * Supports multiple threads as efficiently as statically typed languages.
            * No [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)), as
            this feature eventually gets in the way when creating games. The engine counts
            references and manages the memory for you in most cases by default, but you
            can also control memory if you need to.
            * [Gradual typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing). Variables
            have dynamic types by default, but you also can use type hints for strong type
            checks.

            GDScript looks like Python as you structure your code blocks using indentations,
            but it doesn't work the same way in practice. It's inspired by multiple
            languages, including Squirrel, Lua, and Python.

            > Why don't we use Python or Lua directly?Years ago, Godot used Python, then Lua. Both languages' integration took a
            lot of work and had severe limitations. For example, threading support was a
            big challenge with Python.Developing a dedicated language doesn't take us more work and we can tailor
            it to game developers' needs. We're now working on performance optimizations
            and features that would've been difficult to offer with third-party
            languages.

            As Microsoft's [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) is a favorite
            amongst game developers, we officially support it. C# is a mature and flexible
            language with tons of libraries written for it. We were able to add support for it
            thanks to a generous donation from Microsoft.

            @Step {
                C# offers a good tradeoff between performance and ease of use, although you
                should be aware of its garbage collector.

                > You must use the .NET edition of the Godot editor to script in C#. You
                can download it on the Godot website's [download](https://godotengine.org/download/) page.

                Since Godot uses .NET 8, in theory, you can use any third-party .NET library or
                framework in Godot, as well as any Common Language Infrastructure-compliant
                programming language, such as F#, Boo, or ClojureCLR. However, C# is the only
                officially supported .NET option.

                > GDScript code itself doesn't execute as fast as compiled C# or C++.
                However, most script code calls functions written with fast algorithms
                in C++ code inside the engine. In many cases, writing gameplay logic
                in GDScript, C#, or C++ won't have a significant impact on
                performance.

        @ContentAndMedia {
            GDExtension allows you to write game code in C++ without needing to recompile
            Godot.

        @Steps {
            @Step {
                You can use any version of the language or mix compiler brands and versions for
                the generated shared libraries, thanks to our use of an internal C API Bridge.

                GDExtension is the best choice for performance. You don't need to use it
                throughout an entire game, as you can write other parts in GDScript or C#.

                When working with GDExtension, the available types, functions, and properties
                closely resemble Godot's actual C++ API.

            Scripts are files containing code that you attach to a node to extend its
            functionality.

            Godot supports four official scripting languages, offering you flexibility
            between performance and ease of use.

            You can mix languages, for instance, to implement demanding algorithms with C or
            C++ and write most of the game logic with GDScript or C#.

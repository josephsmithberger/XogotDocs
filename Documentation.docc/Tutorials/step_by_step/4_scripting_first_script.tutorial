            In this lesson, you will code your first script to make the Godot icon turn in
            circles. This tutorial assumes you have some basic programming foundations before you start.
            
            Now that we've stated that, let's have fun learning to code in GDScript!

            start with a clean slate. 
            
            In the file browser dock  on the left you will find one image: the Godot icon or `icon.svg`; which we often use for prototyping in the community.

        @Steps {
            We need to create a Sprite2D node to display it in the game. 
            @Step {
                In the Scene dock,
                press the Other Node button.
                @Image(source: "scripting_first_script_click_other_node.png")
            }
            @Step {
                Tap **All** in the tab bar and then
                type "Sprite2D" in the search bar to filter nodes and double-click on Sprite2D
                to create the node.
                @Image(source: "scripting_first_script_add_sprite_node.png")
            }
            @Step {
                Your Scene tab should now only have a Sprite2D node.
                @Image(source: "scripting_first_script_scene_tree.png")
            }
            @Step {
                A Sprite2D node needs a texture to display. In the Scope on the right, you can open it by tapping the Scope icon if it's closed. 
                
                Inside, you
                can see that the Texture property says `Pick Resource`. 
            }
            @Step {
                To display the
                Godot icon, drag the file `icon.svg` from the FileSystem dock on the left onto the
                Texture slot
                
                Alternatively, tap `Pick Resource` and pick `Load` in the menu that appears. Then in the popup window, choose the icon file and hit `select`. 
                @Image(source: "scripting_first_script_setting_texture.png")
            }
            > Tip: You can create Sprite2D nodes automatically by dragging and dropping images
            on the viewport.
            @Step {
                With the move tool selected, press and drag the icon in the viewport to center it in the game view.
                @Image(source: "scripting_first_script_centering_sprite.png")

    }
    @Section(title: "Creating a new script") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            To create and attach a new script to our node, long-press on Sprite2D in the
            Scene dock and select Attach Script.

            @Image(source: "scripting_first_script_attach_script.png")
        }
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                The Attach Node Script window appears. It allows you to select the script's
                language and file path, among other options.

                Change the Template field from `Node: Default` to `Object: Empty` to
                start with a clean file. Leave the other options set to their default values and
                press the Create button to create the script.
                @Image(source: "scripting_first_script_attach_node_script.png")
            }
            @Step {
                > C# script names need to match their class name. In this case, you should name the
                file `MySprite2D.cs`.

                The Script workspace should appear with your new `sprite_2d.gd` file open and
                the following line of code:

                ``` gdscript
                extends Sprite2D
                ```
            }
            @Step {
                Every GDScript file is implicitly a class. The `extends` keyword defines the
                class this script inherits or extends. In this case, it's `Sprite2D`, meaning
                our script will get access to all the properties and functions of the Sprite2D
                node, including classes it extends, like `Node2D`, `CanvasItem`, and
                `Node`.

                > In GDScript, if you omit the line with the `extends` keyword, your
                class will implicitly extend [`RefCounted`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_RefCounted.html#class-RefCounted), which
                Godot uses to manage your application's memory.

                Inherited properties include the ones you can see in the Inspector dock, like
                our node's `texture`.

                > By default, the Inspector displays a node's properties in "Title Case", with
                capitalized words separated by a space. In GDScript code, these properties
                are in "snake_case", which is lowercase with words separated by an underscore.You can hover over any property's name in the Inspector to see a description and
                its identifier in code.
            }
        }
    }
    @Section(title: "Hello, world!") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            Our script currently doesn't do anything. Let's make it print the text "Hello,
            world!" to the Output bottom panel to get started.

            Add the following code to your script:

            ``` gdscript
            func _init():
                print("Hello, world!")
            ```
        }
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Let's break it down. The `func` keyword defines a new function named
                `_init`. This is a special name for our class's constructor. The engine calls
                `_init()` on every object or node upon creating it in memory, if you define
                this function.

                > GDScript is an indent-based language. The tab at the start of the line
                that says `print()` is necessary for the code to work. If you omit
                it or don't indent a line correctly, the editor will highlight it in
                red and display the following error message: "Indented block expected".

                Save the scene as `sprite_2d.tscn` if you haven't already, then press **Play**
                to run it. Look at the Output bottom panel that expands automatically.
                It should display "Hello, world!".
                @Image(source: "scripting_first_script_print_hello_world.png")
            }
            @Step {
                Delete the `_init()` function, so you're only left with the line `extends
                Sprite2D`.
            }
        }
    }
    @Section(title: "Turning around") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            It's time to make our node move and rotate. To do so, we're going to add two
            member variables to our script: the movement speed in pixels per second and the
            angular speed in radians per second. Add the following after the `extends Sprite2D` line.

            ``` gdscript
            var speed = 400
            var angular_speed = PI
            ```
        }
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Member variables sit near the top of the script, after any "extends" lines,
                but before functions. Every node
                instance with this script attached to it will have its own copy of the `speed`
                and `angular_speed` properties.

                > Angles in Godot work in radians by default,
                but you have built-in functions and properties available if you prefer
                to calculate angles in degrees instead.

                To move our icon, we need to update its position and rotation every frame in the
                game loop. We can use the `_process()` virtual function of the `Node` class.
                If you define it in any class that extends the Node class, like Sprite2D, Godot
                will call the function every frame and pass it an argument named `delta`, the
                time elapsed since the last frame.

                > Games work by rendering many images per second, each called a frame, and
                they do so in a loop. We measure the rate at which a game produces images in
                Frames Per Second (FPS). Most games aim for 60 FPS, although you might find
                figures like 30 FPS on slower mobile devices or 90 to 240 for virtual
                reality games.The engine and game developers do their best to update the game world and
                render images at a constant time interval, but there are always small
                variations in frame render times. That's why the engine provides us with
                this delta time value, making our motion independent of our framerate.

                At the bottom of the script, define the function:

                ``` gdscript
                func _process(delta):
                    rotation += angular_speed * delta
                ```
            }
            @Step {
                The `func` keyword defines a new function. After it, we have to write the
                function's name and arguments it takes in parentheses. A colon ends the
                definition, and the indented blocks that follow are the function's content or
                instructions.

                > Notice how `_process()`, like `_init()`, starts with a leading
                underscore. By convention, Godot's virtual functions, that is to say,
                built-in functions you can override to communicate with the engine,
                start with an underscore.

                The line inside the function, `rotation += angular_speed * delta`, increments
                our sprite's rotation every frame. Here, `rotation` is a property inherited
                from the class `Node2D`, which `Sprite2D` extends. It controls the rotation
                of our node and works with radians.

                > Tip: In the code editor, you can double-tap or select and press `lookup symbol` in the context menu on any built-in property or function like `position`,
                `rotation`, or `_process` to open the corresponding documentation
                in a new tab.

                Run the scene to see the Godot icon turn in-place.
                @Image(source: "scripting_first_script_godot_turning_in_place.gif")
            }
            @Step {
                > In C#, notice how the `delta` argument taken by `_Process()` is a
                `double`. We therefore need to convert it to `float` when we apply
                it to the rotation.
            }
        }
    }
    @Section(title: "Moving forward") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            Let's now make the node move. Add the following two lines inside of the `_process()`
            function, ensuring the new lines are indented the same way as the `rotation += angular_speed * delta` line before
            them.

            ``` gdscript
            var velocity = Vector2.UP.rotated(rotation) * speed

            position += velocity * delta
            ```
        }
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                As we already saw, the `var` keyword defines a new variable. If you put it at
                the top of the script, it defines a property of the class. Inside a function, it
                defines a local variable: it only exists within the function's scope.

                We define a local variable named `velocity`, a 2D vector representing both a
                direction and a speed. To make the node move forward, we start from the Vector2
                class's constant `Vector2.UP`, a vector pointing up, and rotate it by calling the
                Vector2 method `rotated()`. This expression, `Vector2.UP.rotated(rotation)`,
                is a vector pointing forward relative to our icon. Multiplied by our `speed`
                property, it gives us a velocity we can use to move the node forward.

                We add `velocity * delta` to the node's `position` to move it. The position
                itself is of type [`Vector2`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_Vector2.html#class-Vector2), a built-in type in Godot
                representing a 2D vector.

                Run the scene to see the Godot head run in circles.
                @Image(source: "scripting_first_script_rotating_godot.gif")

            @Step {
                > Moving a node like that does not take into account colliding with
                walls or the floor. In <doc:doc_your_first_2d_game>, you will learn
                another approach to moving objects while detecting collisions.

                Our node currently moves by itself. In the next part,
                <doc:doc_scripting_player_input>, we'll use player input to control it.

    }

            Here is the complete `sprite_2d.gd` file for reference.

            ``` gdscript

            var angular_speed = PI


            func _process(delta):
                rotation += angular_speed * delta

                var velocity = Vector2.UP.rotated(rotation) * speed

                position += velocity * delta
            ```

            With the project settings configured and assets in place, we can start working on the
            player-controlled character.

    @Section(title: "Node structure") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            The first scene will define the `Player` object. One of the benefits of
            creating a separate Player scene is that we can test it separately, even before
            we've created other parts of the game.
            
        }
        
        @Steps {
            To begin, we need to choose a **root node** for the player object.
            
            @Step {
                Tap **Create Other Node**.
                
                @Image(source: add_node.png)
            }
            > As a general rule, a scene's root node should reflect the object's 
            desired functionality - what the object *is*.  **With 
            [`Area2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_area2d.html#class-area2d) 
            node, we can detect objects that overlap or run into the player.**
            
            @Step {
                In the Create New Node dialog, search for `Area2D` and tap **Add**
                
                @Image(source: add_area2d.png)
            }
            @Step {
                When you add the `Area2D` node, Godot will display a **warning icon** 
                (1) next to it in the Scene Tree.
                
                > Note: This warning tells us that the `Area2D` node requires a shape to detect collisions or overlaps.
                
                > Important: We can **ignore the warning temporarily** because we will first set up the player's visuals
                (using an animated sprite).
                
                @Image(source: no_shape_warning.png)
            }
            
            Once the visuals are ready, we will add a collision shape as a child
            node. This will allow us to accurately size and position the shape based on the sprite’s appearance.
            
            @Step {
                Let's change the node's name to `Player`.
                
                > Important: When you create a new node, the node's name will be editable so that you can give it a
                new name immediately it; however, you can always rename it again by *long-pressing* the 
                node name in the Scene Tree and selecting **Rename**. 
                
                @Image(source: rename_player.png)
            }
            @Step {                
                Now that we've configured the scene's root node, we can add additional nodes to give 
                it more functionality.  Before we add any children to the `Player` node, let's group them
                to make sure we don't accidentally move or resize them by tapping on them. 
                
                @Image(source: lock_children.png)
            }
            @Step {
                With the `Player` node selected (1), tap the Group Nodes icon to the right of the lock on 
                the Viewport's toolbar (2). Whenever one of these toolbar buttons is tapped, a momentary tip 
                will apper - in this case, "Groups selected nodes". 
                
                > Note: Grouping nodes causes the parent to be 
                selected when any child node is tapped in the 2D or 3D view.
                
                @Image(source: lock_children.png)
            }
            @Step {                
               Let's save the scene.  Tap the dropdown arrow next to "[unsaved] ..." at the
               top of the app (1) and select **Save Scene** (2).  Alternatively, you can press 
               `Cmd + S` on an external keyboard.
               
               @Image(source: save_scene.png)
               
            }
            
            > Important: For this project, we will be following the <doc:gdscript_styleguide>.
            Classes (nodes) use PascalCase, variables and functions use snake_case, and constants use ALL_CAPS.  
            
            @Step {
                You can tap **Save** to accept the default proposed file name: `player.tscn`.
            }
        }
    }
    @Section(title: "Sprite animation") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            We are now ready to add graphics and animation to our `Player`. 
        }
        @Steps {
            @Step {  
                Tap on the **+** at the top of the Scene Tree (the upper-left side of the app)
                
                @Image(source: new_node.png)
            }
            An `AnimatedSprite2D` will handle the appearance and animations for our player.
            @Step {  
                Search for `AnimatedSprite2D` node and tap **Add**.
                
                @Image(source: animated_sprite_2d.png)
            }
            >Important:  Notice that there is a **warning icon** next to the new node. An `AnimatedSprite2D` 
            requires a `SpriteFrames` resource, which is a list of the animations it can
            display. To create one, we'll need to open the `Inspector`. 
            @Step {  
                Tap the "scope" icon (1) in the upper-right corner of the app to show the Inspector.
                
                > The Inspector shows various properties and settings for the currently selected
                node, with related settings grouped into sections. 
                @Image(source: inspector.png)
            }
            @Step { 
                
                Tap **Animation** in the inspector to navigate into the new `AnimatedSprite2D` node's
                Animation settings.
                
                @Image(source: inspector_animation.png)
            }
            @Step {   
                Find the **Sprite Frames** property under **Animation** and tap **Pick Resource**. Select **New SpriteFrames** from the popup menu.
                
                @Image(source: new_spriteframes.png)
            }
            > The **warning icon** has been removed, and there is a new **SpriteFrames** tab button
            visible at the bottom of the screen.
            @Step {  
                
                We're done with the *Inspector* for now, so let's 
                hide it by tapping the *scope* toolbar button.
                
                Expand the *SpriteFrames* panel by tapping **SpriteFrames** at the bottom of the app.
                
                @Image(source: spriteframes_button.png)
            }
            
            The new SpriteFrames starts out with an empty animation named "default".
            @Step {  
                
                Tap **Animation** (1) in the SpriteFrames toolbar, then tap **`default`** (2) and 
                select **Rename Animation** (3) to rename the animation to "`walk`". 
                
                @Image(source: spriteframes_panel.png)
            }
            @Step {
                Find the player images in the File Pad - they're in the `art` folder you imported 
                earlier. 
                
                Drag each image for the `walk` animation (named `playerGrey_walk1.png` and 
                `playerGrey_walk2.png`) from the File Pad (1) into the **Animation Frames** side of 
                the *SpriteFrames* panel for the `walk` animation.
                
                @Image(source: spriteframes_walk.png)
            }
            @Step {  
                Tap **Animation** (1) and select **New Animation** (2) to create a second animation.
                
                Rename the **new_animation**  to "`up`". 
                
                @Image(source: new_animation.png)
            }
            @Step {
                With the new **up** animation selected, you can now drag the `up` animation 
                images (named `playerGrey_up1.png` and `playerGrey_up2.png`) into **SpriteFrames** 
                panel for the 'up' animation.
                
                > Important: Your **SpriteFrames** should now look like this:
                
                @Image(source: spriteframes_complete.png)
            }
            The player images are a bit too large for the game window, so we need to scale
            them down. 
            @Step {
                
                Tap on the `AnimatedSprite2D` node and set the **Scale** **X** and **Y** properties 
                to `(0.5, 0.5)`. 
                
                > Tip: You can find `Scale` by navigating into the **Transform** section 
                in the Inspector under the `Node2D` heading.
                
                @Image(source: player_scale.png)
                
             }
         }
     }
     @Section(title: "Collision detection") {
         @ContentAndMedia {
             Finally, for this scene, let's' set `Player` up for collision detection.
         }
         @Steps {
            @Step {
                With the `Player` node selected, tap the **+** button in the Scene Tree (1)
                to add a [`CollisionShape2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_collisionshape2d.html#class-collisionshape2d)
                as a child of `Player`. 
                
                > Note: This will determine the player's "hitbox", or the bounds of its
                collision area. 
                
                @Image(source: collision_shape_2d.png)
            }
            For this character, a `CapsuleShape2D` node gives the best fit.  
            @Step {
                Open the Inspector and ensure that `CollisionShape2D` is selected in the Scene Tree. Then, next to **Shape** in the Inspector, tap **Pick Resource** -> **New** -> **New
                CapsuleShape2D**.                 
                
                @Image(source: player_new_capsule.png)
            }
            @Step {            
                Using the two size handles, resize the shape to cover the
                sprite.
                
                @Image(source: player_coll_shape.png)
            }
            @Step {            
                Once this is done, the warning on the `Area2D` node will disappear, as it now has
                a shape assigned and can interact with other objects.
                
                > Important: When you're finished, your `Player` scene should look like this:
                
                @Image(source: player_scene_complete.png)
            }
        }
    }
}

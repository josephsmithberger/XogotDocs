            In this short first part, we'll set up and organize the project.

                Launch Xogot and tap **"New Game"** on the `Projects` tab to create a new project.

            @Step {
                When creating the new project, you only need to choose a valid *Project Name*
                and tap the **Add** button. 
                
                By default, your project will be saved inside Xogot's dedicated file storage.

                This game is designed for portrait mode, so we need to adjust the size of the
                game window. 
                
                Tap on the **Switch** toolbar button (1) in the upper-right corner
                of Xogot and tap **Settings** (2) to open the *P*roject Settings* dialog.

            }
            @Step {            
                In the left column, tap *Window* under the **Display** section (1).
                
                In the panel on the right, set **Viewport Width** to `480` and 
                **Viewport Height** to `720` (2).
                
                @Image(source: project-settings-size.png)  
            }
            @Step {            
                Scroll to **Stretch** options and set **Mode** to `canvas_items` and **Aspect** to `keep`.
                This ensures that the game scales consistently on different sized screens.
                
                Under **Handheld** options, set **Orientation** to `Portrait`.
                
                @Image(source: project-settings-stretch.png)
            }
            @Step {            
                We will configure this game to support controlling the player with a wireless 
                gamepad; however, we will also enable Xogot's support for displaying an [onscreen 
                virtual controller](https://docs.xogot.com/documentation/xogot/onscreen-controls) 
                when an external controller is not connected.
                
                In the left column, scroll to **Input Devices** and tap *Virtual Controller*. 
                Toggle **Enable Controller** on.  We will only use the Right Thumbstick, so
                we can go ahead and toggle off all of the buttons, as well as the Left 
                Thumbstick.

                Please download the Project files linked at the top of this tutorial.  By default, 
                Safari will save the zip file to the iPad's `Downloads` folder.   
                
                If you do not already have Apple's Files App installed, you should 
                [install Files App from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/files/id1232058109)

            }
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                We'll use the iPad's split view to import assets downloaded to the iPad.  
                
                Split the view between Xogot and Files App by tapping the **"..."** (1) at the top of the 
                screen and selecting **"Split View"** (2).
                
                @Image(source: split-view.png)
            }
            @Step {
                Xogot will move to one side of the screen in order to reveal your iPad's homescreen. 
                
                Locate and tap the Files icon to open Files App on the other half of your screen.
                
                @Image(source: split-view-files.png)
            }
            @Step {
                Inside Files App, browse to **`Downloads`** under **Favorites**
                
                @Image(source: split-view-download.png)
            }
            @Step {
                Tap **`dodge_the_creeps_2d_assets.zip`** (1) to uncompress the zip file.
                
                Navigate into the **`dodge_the_creeps_2d_assets`** folder (2) by tapping it.
                
                @Image(source: split-view-dodge.png)
            }
            @Step {
                Drag the **`art`** folder (1) to **`res://`** in Xogot's File pad to import the art folder 
                into the root of your project. 
                
                Next, drag the **`fonts`** folder to **`res://`** to import the fonts 
                
                @Image(source: split-view-drag.png)                
            }
            @Step {                          
                The File pad should now have `art` and `fonts` folders immediately under `res://`
                
                You can return Xogot to full screen by tapping the **...** at the top of Xogot
                and selecting **"Full Screen"**.

## Build 2225

* We clear error messages when we restart a game

* Bottom tabs no longer collapse when an action takes place on them (Animations, Sprite Editor).

* By default scripts and scenes are automatically synchronized during development, like Godot on desktop does.

* It is now possible to edit array of NodePaths exported by scripts in the inspector.

* The animation lenght no longer auto-resets to one second.

* It is now possible to zoom out from TileSets and not force the full size.

* Selected Tiles in the Tile pads now get a more prominent selection indicator.

* Rendering options for the 3D viewport now match their descriptions.

* Virtual controllers that were sticky after a game ended now get properly removed from the screen.

* When Xogot is running in half-screen, tapping on the "Script" icon, will now automatically hide the sidebar, so you can see your script.

        This series will introduce you to Xogot and give you an overview of its features.

        In the following pages, you will get answers to questions such as "Is Xogot for me?" 
        or "What can I do with Xogot?". We will then introduce the engine's most essential 
        concepts, run you through the editor's interface, and give you tips to make the most 
        of your time learning it.

        In this step-by-step tutorial series, you will create your first complete 2D game 
        with Godot. By the end of the series, you will have a simple yet finished project 
        of your own like this animation.

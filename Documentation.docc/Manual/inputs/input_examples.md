# Input examples

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Godot's [InputEvent](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputevent.html#class-inputevent)
system to capture player input. There are many different types of input your
game may use - keyboard, gamepad, mouse, etc. - and many different ways to
turn those inputs into actions in your game. This document will show you some
of the most common scenarios, which you can use as starting points for your
own projects.

## Events versus polling

Sometimes you want your game to respond to a certain input event - pressing
the "jump" button, for example. For other situations, you might want something
to happen as long as a key is pressed, such as movement. In the first case,
you can use the _input() function, which will be called whenever an input
event occurs. In the second case, Godot provides the [Input](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_input.html#class-input)
singleton, which you can use to query the state of an input.

Examples:

This gives you the flexibility to mix-and-match the type of input processing
you do.

For the remainder of this tutorial, we'll focus on capturing individual
events in _input().

## Input events

Input events are objects that inherit from [InputEvent](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputevent.html#class-inputevent).
Depending on the event type, the object will contain specific properties
related to that event. To see what events actually look like, add a Node and
attach the following script:

As you press keys, move the mouse, and perform other inputs, you'll see each
event scroll by in the output window. Here's an example of the output:

```
A
Mouse motion at position ((971, 5)) with velocity ((0, 0))
Right Mouse Button
Mouse motion at position ((870, 243)) with velocity ((0.454937, -0.454937))
Left Mouse Button
Mouse Wheel Up
A
B
Shift
Alt+Shift
Alt
Shift+T
Mouse motion at position ((868, 242)) with velocity ((-2.134768, 2.134768))
```

As you can see, the results are very different for the different types of
input. Key events are even printed as their key symbols. For example, let's
consider [InputEventMouseButton](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputeventmousebutton.html#class-inputeventmousebutton).
It inherits from the following classes:

- [InputEvent](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputevent.html#class-inputevent) - the base class for all input events

- [InputEventWithModifiers](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputeventwithmodifiers.html#class-inputeventwithmodifiers) - adds the ability to check if modifiers are pressed, such as `Shift` or `Alt`.

- [InputEventMouse](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputeventmouse.html#class-inputeventmouse) - adds mouse event properties, such as position

- [InputEventMouseButton](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputeventmousebutton.html#class-inputeventmousebutton) - contains the index of the button that was pressed, whether it was a double-click, etc.

> methods.

You can encounter errors if you try to access a property on an input type that
doesn't contain it - calling position on InputEventKey for example. To
avoid this, make sure to test the event type first:

## InputMap

The [InputMap](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputmap.html#class-inputmap) is the most flexible way to handle a
variety of inputs. You use this by creating named input actions, to which
you can assign any number of input events, such as keypresses or mouse clicks.
To see them, and to add your own, open Project -> Project Settings and select
the InputMap tab:

> Tip:
> A new Godot project includes a number of default actions already defined.
> To see them, turn on Show Built-in Actions in the InputMap dialog.

### Capturing actions

Once you've defined your actions, you can process them in your scripts using
is_action_pressed() and is_action_released() by passing the name of
the action you're looking for:

## Keyboard events

Keyboard events are captured in [InputEventKey](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputeventkey.html#class-inputeventkey).
While it's recommended to use input actions instead, there may be cases where
you want to specifically look at key events. For this example, let's check for
the `T`:

> Tip: See :ref:`@GlobalScope_Key <enum_@GlobalScope_Key>` for a list of keycode
> constants.
>

> Warning:
>
> Due to keyboard ghosting, not all key inputs may be registered at a given time
> if you press too many keys at once. Due to their location on the keyboard,
> certain keys are more prone to ghosting than others. Some keyboards feature
> antighosting at a hardware level, but this feature is generally
> not present on low-end keyboards and laptop keyboards.
>
> As a result, it's recommended to use a default keyboard layout that is designed to work well
> on a keyboard without antighosting. See
> this Gamedev Stack Exchange question
> for more information.

### Keyboard modifiers

Modifier properties are inherited from
[InputEventWithModifiers](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputeventwithmodifiers.html#class-inputeventwithmodifiers). This allows
you to check for modifier combinations using boolean properties. Let's imagine
you want one thing to happen when the `T` is pressed, but something
different when it's `Shift + T`:

> Tip: See :ref:`@GlobalScope_Key <enum_@GlobalScope_Key>` for a list of keycode
> constants.

## Mouse events

Mouse events stem from the [InputEventMouse](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputeventmouse.html#class-inputeventmouse) class, and
are separated into two types: [InputEventMouseButton](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputeventmousebutton.html#class-inputeventmousebutton)
and [InputEventMouseMotion](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputeventmousemotion.html#class-inputeventmousemotion). Note that this
means that all mouse events will contain a position property.

### Mouse buttons

Capturing mouse buttons is very similar to handling key events. :ref:`@GlobalScope_MouseButton <enum_@GlobalScope_MouseButton>`
contains a list of MOUSE_BUTTON_* constants for each possible button, which will
be reported in the event's button_index property. Note that the scrollwheel
also counts as a button - two buttons, to be precise, with both
MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_UP and MOUSE_BUTTON_WHEEL_DOWN being separate events.

### Mouse motion

[InputEventMouseMotion](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputeventmousemotion.html#class-inputeventmousemotion) events occur whenever
the mouse moves. You can find the move's distance with the relative
property.

Here's an example using mouse events to drag-and-drop a [Sprite2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_sprite2d.html#class-sprite2d)
node:

## Touch events

If you are using a touchscreen device, you can generate touch events.
[InputEventScreenTouch](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputeventscreentouch.html#class-inputeventscreentouch) is equivalent to
a mouse click event, and [InputEventScreenDrag](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputeventscreendrag.html#class-inputeventscreendrag)
works much the same as mouse motion.

> Tip: To test your touch events on a non-touchscreen device, open Project
> Settings and go to the "Input Devices/Pointing" section. Enable "Emulate
> Touch From Mouse" and your project will interpret mouse clicks and
> motion as touch events.

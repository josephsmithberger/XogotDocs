# Output panel

The output panel is found at the bottom of the screen. Tap on **Output** to open it.

The output panel provides several features to make viewing text printed by the
project (and editor) easier.


## Message categories

Four message categories are available:

- **Log:** Standard messages printed by the project. Displayed in white or black
(depending on the editor theme).

- **Error:** Messages printed by the project or editor that indicate a failure
of some kind. Displayed in red.

- **Warning:** Messages printed by the project or editor that report important
information, but do not indicate a failure. Displayed in yellow.

- **Editor:** Messages printed by the editor, typically intended to be traces of
undo/redo actions. Displayed in gray.

## Filtering messages

You can utilize the search bar on the bottom right to filter messages.
This can make it easier to find specific messages you're looking for.

## Clearing messages

When running the project, existing messages can pile up.
You can clear messages by tapping the "Trash" icon to the right of the "Filter" search bar.

## Printing messages

Several methods are available to print messages:

- [print()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_@globalscope_method_print.html#class-@globalscope_method_print): Prints a message.
This method accepts multiple arguments which are concatenated together upon printing.
This method has variants that separate arguments with tabs and spaces respectively:
[printt()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_@globalscope_method_printt.html#class-@globalscope_method_printt) and [prints()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_@globalscope_method_prints.html#class-@globalscope_method_prints).

- [print_rich()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_@globalscope_method_print_rich.html#class-@globalscope_method_print_rich): Same as `print()`,
but BBCode can be used to format the text that is printed (see below).

- [push_error()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_@globalscope_method_push_error.html#class-@globalscope_method_push_error): Prints an error message.
When an error is printed in a running project, it's displayed in the **Debugger > Errors**
tab instead.

- [push_warning()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_@globalscope_method_push_warning.html#class-@globalscope_method_push_warning): Prints a warning message.
When a warning is printed in a running project, it's displayed in the **Debugger > Errors**
tab instead.

For more complex use cases, these can be used:

- [print_verbose()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_@globalscope_method_print_verbose.html#class-@globalscope_method_print_verbose): Same as `print()`,
but only prints when verbose mode is enabled in the Project Settings
or the project is run with the `--verbose` command line argument.

- [printerr()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_@globalscope_method_printerr.html#class-@globalscope_method_printerr): Same as `print()`,
but prints to the standard error stream instead of the standard output string.
`push_error()` should be preferred in most cases.

- [printraw()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_@globalscope_method_printraw.html#class-@globalscope_method_printraw): Same as `print()`,
but prints without a blank line at the end. This is the only method
that does **not** print to the editor Output panel.
It prints to the standard output stream only, which means it's still included
in file logging.

- [print_stack()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_@gdscript_method_print_stack.html#class-@gdscript_method_print_stack): Print a stack trace
from the current location. Only supported when running from the editor,
or when the project is exported in debug mode.

- [print_tree()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node_method_print_tree.html#class-node_method_print_tree): Prints the scene tree
relative to the current node. Useful for debugging node structures created at runtime.

- [print_tree_pretty()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node_method_print_tree_pretty.html#class-node_method_print_tree_pretty): Same as
`print_tree()`, but with Unicode characters for a more tree-like appearance. This relies on
box-drawing characters,
so it may not render correctly with all fonts.

To get more advanced formatting capabilities, consider using
<doc:gdscript_format_string> along with the above printing functions.

### Printing rich text

Using [print_rich()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_@globalscope_method_print_rich.html#class-@globalscope_method_print_rich), you can print
rich text to the editor Output panel and standard output (visible when the user
runs the project from a terminal). This works by converting the BBCode to
ANSI escape codes that the
terminal understands.

In the editor output, all BBCode tags are recognized as usual. In the terminal
output, only a subset of BBCode tags will work, as documented in the linked
`print_rich()` method description above. In the terminal, the colors will look
different depending on the user's theme, while colors in the editor will use the
same colors as they would in the project.

> Note:
>
> ANSI escape code support varies across terminal emulators. The exact colors
> displayed in terminal output also depend on the terminal theme chosen by the user.

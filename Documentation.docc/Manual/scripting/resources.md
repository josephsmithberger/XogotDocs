# Resources

## Nodes and resources

Up to this tutorial, we focused on the [Node](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html#class-node)
class in Godot as that's the one you use to code behavior and
most of the engine's features rely on it. There is
another datatype that is just as important:
[Resource](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_resource.html#class-resource).

Nodes give you functionality: they draw sprites, 3D models, simulate physics,
arrange user interfaces, etc. **Resources** are **data containers**. They don't
do anything on their own: instead, nodes use the data contained in resources.

Anything Godot saves or loads from disk is a resource. Be it a scene (a .tscn
or an .scn file), an image, a script... Here are some [Resource](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_resource.html#class-resource) examples:

- [Texture](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_texture.html#class-texture)

- [Script](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_script.html#class-script)

- [Mesh](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_mesh.html#class-mesh)

- [Animation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_animation.html#class-animation)

- [AudioStream](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_audiostream.html#class-audiostream)

- [Font](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_font.html#class-font)

- [Translation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_translation.html#class-translation)

When the engine loads a resource from disk, **it only loads it once**. If a copy
of that resource is already in memory, trying to load the resource again will
return the same copy every time. As resources only contain data, there is no need
to duplicate them.

Every object, be it a Node or a Resource, can export properties. There are many
types of Properties, like String, integer, Vector2, etc., and any of these types
can become a resource. This means that both nodes and resources can contain
resources as properties:

## External vs built-in

There are two ways to save resources. They can be:

1. **External** to a scene, saved on the disk as individual files.

1. **Built-in**, saved inside the .tscn or the .scn file they're attached to.

To be more specific, here's a [Texture2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_texture2d.html#class-texture2d)
in a [Sprite2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_sprite2d.html#class-sprite2d) node:

@Image(source: "spriteprop.png")

Clicking the resource preview allows us to view the resource's properties.

@Image(source: "resourcerobi.png")

The path property tells us where the resource comes from. In this case, it comes
from a PNG image called robi.png. When the resource comes from a file like
this, it is an external resource. If you erase the path or this path is empty,
it becomes a built-in resource.

The switch between built-in and external resources happens when you save the
scene. In the example above, if you erase the path "res://robi.png" and
save, Godot will save the image inside the .tscn scene file.

> Note:
>
> Even if you save a built-in resource, when you instance a scene multiple
> times, the engine will only load one copy of it.

## Loading resources from code

There are two ways to load resources from code. First, you can use the load() function anytime:

You can also preload resources. Unlike load, this function will read the
file from disk and load it at compile-time. As a result, you cannot call preload
with a variable path: you need to use a constant string.

## Loading scenes

Scenes are also resources, but there is a catch. Scenes saved to disk are
resources of type [PackedScene](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_packedscene.html#class-packedscene). The
scene is packed inside a [Resource](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_resource.html#class-resource).

To get an instance of the scene, you have to use the
[PackedScene.instantiate()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_packedscene_method_instantiate.html#class-packedscene_method_instantiate) method.

This method creates the nodes in the scene's hierarchy, configures them, and
returns the root node of the scene. You can then add it as a child of any other
node.

The approach has several advantages. As the [PackedScene.instantiate()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_packedscene_method_instantiate.html#class-packedscene_method_instantiate) function is fast, you can create new
enemies, bullets, effects, etc. without having to load them again from disk each
time. Remember that, as always, images, meshes, etc. are all shared between the
scene instances.

## Freeing resources

When a [Resource](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_resource.html#class-resource) is no longer in use, it will automatically free itself.
Since, in most cases, Resources are contained in Nodes, when you free a node,
the engine frees all the resources it owns as well if no other node uses them.

## Creating your own resources

Like any Object in Godot, users can also script Resources. Resource scripts
inherit the ability to freely translate between object properties and serialized
text or binary data (*.tres, *.res). They also inherit the reference-counting
memory management from the RefCounted type.

This comes with many distinct advantages over alternative data
structures, such as JSON, CSV, or custom TXT files. Users can only import these
assets as a [Dictionary](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_dictionary.html#class-dictionary) (JSON) or as a
[FileAccess](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_fileaccess.html#class-fileaccess) to parse. What sets Resources apart is their
inheritance of [Object](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_object.html#class-object), [RefCounted](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_refcounted.html#class-refcounted),
and [Resource](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_resource.html#class-resource) features:

- They can define constants, so constants from other data fields or objects are not needed.

- They can define methods, including setter/getter methods for properties. This allows for abstraction and encapsulation of the underlying data. If the Resource script's structure needs to change, the game using the Resource need not also change.

- They can define signals, so Resources can trigger responses to changes in the data they manage.

- They have defined properties, so users know 100% that their data will exist.

- Resource auto-serialization and deserialization is a built-in Godot Engine feature. Users do not need to implement custom logic to import/export a resource file's data.

- Resources can even serialize sub-Resources recursively, meaning users can design even more sophisticated data structures.

- Users can save Resources as version-control-friendly text files (*.tres). Upon exporting a game, Godot serializes resource files as binary files (*.res) for increased speed and compression.

- Godot Engine's Inspector renders and edits Resource files out-of-the-box. As such, users often do not need to implement custom logic to visualize or edit their data. To do so, double-click the resource file in the FileSystem dock or click the folder icon in the Inspector and open the file in the dialog.

- They can extend **other** resource types besides just the base Resource.

Godot makes it easy to create custom Resources in the Inspector.

1. Create a new Resource object in the Inspector. This can even be a type that derives Resource, so long as your script is extending that type.

1. Set the script property in the Inspector to be your script.

The Inspector will now display your Resource script's custom properties. If one edits
those values and saves the resource, the Inspector serializes the custom properties
too! To save a resource from the Inspector, click the save icon at the top of the Inspector,
and select "Save" or "Save As...".

If the script's language supports <doc:index#Basics-Class-Name>,
then it streamlines the process. Defining a name for your script alone will add it to
the Inspector's creation dialog. This will auto-add your script to the Resource
object you create.

Let's see some examples.
Create a [Resource](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_resource.html#class-resource) and name it bot_stats.
It should appear in your file tab with the full name bot_stats.tres.
Without a script, it's useless, so let's add some data and logic!
Attach a script to it named bot_stats.gd (or just create a new script, and then drag it to it).

> Note:
> To make the new resource class appear in the Create Resource GUI you need to provide a class name for GDScript, or use the [GlobalClass] attribute in C#.
>

Now, create a [CharacterBody3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_characterbody3d.html#class-characterbody3d), name it Bot, and add the following script to it:

Now, select the [CharacterBody3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_characterbody3d.html#class-characterbody3d) node which we named bot, and drag&drop the bot_stats.tres resource onto the Inspector. It should print 10! Obviously, this setup can be used for more advanced features than this, but as long you really understand how it all worked, you should figure out everything else related to Resources.

> Warning:
>

# Default editor shortcuts

Many Godot editor functions can be executed with keyboard shortcuts. This page
lists functions which have associated shortcuts by default, but many others are
available for customization in editor settings as well. To change keys associated
with these and other actions navigate to **Editor > Editor Settings > Shortcuts**.

While some actions are universal, a lot of shortcuts are specific to individual
tools. For this reason it is possible for some key combinations to be assigned
to more than one function. The correct action will be performed depending on the
context.

> Note:
>
> While Windows and Linux builds of the editor share most of the default settings,
> some shortcuts may differ for macOS version. This is done for better integration
> of the editor into macOS ecosystem. Users fluent with standard shortcuts on that
> OS should find Godot Editor's default key mapping intuitive.

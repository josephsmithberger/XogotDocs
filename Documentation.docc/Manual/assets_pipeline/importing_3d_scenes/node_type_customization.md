# Node type customization using name suffixes

Many times, when editing a scene, there are common tasks that need to be done
after exporting:

- Adding collision detection to objects.

- Setting objects as navigation meshes.

- Deleting nodes that are not used in the game engine (like specific lights used
for modeling).

To simplify this workflow, Godot offers several suffixes that can be added to
the names of the objects in your 3D modeling software. When imported, Godot
will detect suffixes in object names and will perform actions automatically.

> Warning:

> All the suffixes described below can be used with -, $, and _ and are
> **case-insensitive**.

## Remove nodes (-noimp)

Objects that have the -noimp suffix will be removed at import-time no matter
what their type is. They will not appear in the imported scene.

This is equivalent to enabling **Skip Import** for a node in the Advanced Import
Settings dialog.

## Create collisions (-col, -convcol, -colonly, -convcolonly)

The option -col will work only for Mesh objects. If it is detected, a child
static collision node will be added, using the same geometry as the mesh. This
will create a triangle mesh collision shape, which is a slow, but accurate
option for collision detection. This option is usually what you want for level
geometry (but see also -colonly below).

The option -convcol will create a [ConvexPolygonShape3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_convexpolygonshape3d.html#class-convexpolygonshape3d) instead of
a [ConcavePolygonShape3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_concavepolygonshape3d.html#class-concavepolygonshape3d). Unlike triangle meshes which can be concave,
a convex shape can only accurately represent a shape that doesn't have any
concave angles (a pyramid is convex, but a hollow box is concave). Due to this,
convex collision shapes are generally not suited for level geometry. When
representing simple enough meshes, convex collision shapes can result in better
performance compared to a triangle collision shape. This option is ideal for
simple or dynamic objects that require mostly-accurate collision detection.

However, in both cases, the visual geometry may be too complex or not smooth
enough for collisions. This can create physics glitches and slow down the engine
unnecessarily.

To solve this, the -colonly modifier exists. It will remove the mesh upon
importing and will create a [StaticBody3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_staticbody3d.html#class-staticbody3d) collision instead.
This helps the visual mesh and actual collision to be separated.

The option -convcolonly works in a similar way, but will create a
[ConvexPolygonShape3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_convexpolygonshape3d.html#class-convexpolygonshape3d) instead using convex decomposition.

With Collada files, the option -colonly can also be used with Blender's
empty objects. On import, it will create a [StaticBody3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_staticbody3d.html#class-staticbody3d) with a
collision node as a child. The collision node will have one of a number of
predefined shapes, depending on Blender's empty draw type:

@Image(source: "importing_3d_scenes_blender_empty_draw_types.png", alt: "Choosing a draw type for an Empty on creation in Blender") {Choosing a draw type for an Empty on creation in Blender}

- Single arrow will create a [SeparationRayShape3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_separationrayshape3d.html#class-separationrayshape3d).

- Cube will create a [BoxShape3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_boxshape3d.html#class-boxshape3d).

- Image will create a [WorldBoundaryShape3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_worldboundaryshape3d.html#class-worldboundaryshape3d).

- Sphere (and the others not listed) will create a [SphereShape3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_sphereshape3d.html#class-sphereshape3d).

When possible, **try to use a few primitive collision shapes** instead of triangle
mesh or convex shapes. Primitive shapes often have the best performance and
reliability.

## Create Occluder (-occ, -occonly)

If a mesh is imported with the -occ suffix an [occluder3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_occluder3d.html#class-occluder3d) node
will be created based on the geometry of the mesh, it does not replace the mesh.
A mesh node with the -occonly suffix will be converted to an
[occluder3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_occluder3d.html#class-occluder3d) on import.

## Create navigation (-navmesh)

A mesh node with the -navmesh suffix will be converted to a navigation mesh.
The original Mesh object will be removed at import-time.

## Create a VehicleBody (-vehicle)

A mesh node with the -vehicle suffix will be imported as a child to a
[VehicleBody3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vehiclebody3d.html#class-vehiclebody3d) node.

## Create a VehicleWheel (-wheel)

A mesh node with the -wheel suffix will be imported as a child to a
[VehicleWheel3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vehiclewheel3d.html#class-vehiclewheel3d) node.

## Rigid Body (-rigid)

A mesh node with the -rigid suffix will be imported as a [RigidBody3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_rigidbody3d.html#class-rigidbody3d).

## Animation loop (-loop, -cycle)

Animation clips in the source 3D file that start or end with the token loop or cycle
will be imported as a Godot [Animation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_animation.html#class-animation) with the loop flag set.
**Unlike the other suffixes described above, this does not require a hyphen.**

In Blender, this requires using the NLA Editor and naming the Action with the loop or
cycle prefix or suffix.

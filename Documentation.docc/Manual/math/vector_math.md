# Vector math

## Introduction

This tutorial is a short and practical introduction to linear algebra as it
applies to game development. Linear algebra is the study of vectors and their
uses. Vectors have many applications in both 2D and 3D development and Godot
uses them extensively. Developing a good understanding of vector math is
essential to becoming a strong game developer.

## Coordinate systems (2D)

In 2D space, coordinates are defined using a horizontal axis (x) and a
vertical axis (y). A particular position in 2D space is written as a pair of
values such as (4, 3).

Any position in the 2D plane can be identified by a pair of numbers in this way.
However, we can also think of the position (4, 3) as an **offset** from the
(0, 0) point, or **origin**. Draw an arrow pointing from the origin to the
point:

@Image(source: "vector_xy1.png")

This is a **vector**. A vector represents a lot of useful information. As well
as telling us that the point is at (4, 3), we can also think of it as an
angle θ (theta) and a length (or magnitude) m. In this case, the arrow
is a **position vector** - it denotes a position in space, relative to the
origin.

A very important point to consider about vectors is that they only represent
**relative** direction and magnitude. There is no concept of a vector's
position. The following two vectors are identical:

@Image(source: "vector_xy2.png")

Both vectors represent a point 4 units to the right and 3 units below some
starting point. It does not matter where on the plane you draw the vector, it
always represents a relative direction and magnitude.

## Vector operations

You can use either method (x and y coordinates or angle and magnitude) to refer
to a vector, but for convenience, programmers typically use the coordinate
notation. For example, in Godot, the origin is the top-left corner of the
screen, so to place a 2D node named Node2D 400 pixels to the right and 300
pixels down, use the following code:

Godot supports both [Vector2](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2) and [Vector3](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector3.html#class-vector3) for 2D and 3D usage, respectively. The same mathematical rules
discussed in this article apply to both types, and wherever we link to
Vector2 methods in the class reference, you can also check out their
Vector3 counterparts.

### Member access

The individual components of the vector can be accessed directly by name.

### Adding vectors

When adding or subtracting two vectors, the corresponding components are added:

We can also see this visually by adding the second vector at the end of
the first:

@Image(source: "vector_add1.png")

Note that adding a + b gives the same result as b + a.

### Scalar multiplication

> Note: Vectors represent both direction and magnitude. A value representing
> only magnitude is called a **scalar**. Scalars use the
> [float](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_float.html#class-float) type in Godot.

A vector can be multiplied by a **scalar**:

> its magnitude. Multiplying with a negative scalar results in a vector in the
> opposite direction. This is how you **scale** a vector.

## Practical applications

Let's look at two common uses for vector addition and subtraction.

### Movement

A vector can represent **any** quantity with a magnitude and direction. Typical
examples are: position, velocity, acceleration, and force. In this image, the
spaceship at step 1 has a position vector of (1, 3) and a velocity vector of
(2, 1). The velocity vector represents how far the ship moves each step. We
can find the position for step 2 by adding the velocity to the current position.

@Image(source: "vector_movement1.png")

> position is found by adding the velocity multiplied by the elapsed time
> (here assumed to be one unit, e.g. 1 s) to the previous position.

> or [_physics_process()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node_private_method__physics_process.html#class-node_private_method__physics_process)
> callbacks.

### Pointing toward a target

In this scenario, you have a tank that wishes to point its turret at a robot.
Subtracting the tank's position from the robot's position gives the vector
pointing from the tank to the robot.

> Tip: To find a vector pointing from A to B, use B - A.

## Unit vectors

A vector with **magnitude** of 1 is called a **unit vector**. They are also
sometimes referred to as **direction vectors** or **normals**. Unit vectors are
helpful when you need to keep track of a direction.

### Normalization

**Normalizing** a vector means reducing its length to 1 while preserving its
direction. This is done by dividing each of its components by its magnitude.
Because this is such a common operation, Godot provides a dedicated
[normalized()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2_method_normalized.html#class-vector2_method_normalized) method for this:

> Warning: Because normalization involves dividing by the vector's length, you
> cannot normalize a vector of length 0. Attempting to do so
> would normally result in an error. In GDScript though, trying to
> call the normalized() method on a vector of length 0 leaves the
> value untouched and avoids the error for you.
>

### Reflection

A common use of unit vectors is to indicate **normals**. Normal vectors are unit
vectors aligned perpendicularly to a surface, defining its direction. They are
commonly used for lighting, collisions, and other operations involving surfaces.

For example, imagine we have a moving ball that we want to bounce off a wall or
other object:

@Image(source: "vector_reflect1.png")

The surface normal has a value of (0, -1) because this is a horizontal
surface. When the ball collides, we take its remaining motion (the amount left
over when it hits the surface) and reflect it using the normal. In Godot, there
is a [bounce()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2_method_bounce.html#class-vector2_method_bounce) method to handle this.
Here is a code example of the above diagram using a [CharacterBody2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_characterbody2d.html#class-characterbody2d):

## Dot product

The **dot product** is one of the most important concepts in vector math, but is
often misunderstood. Dot product is an operation on two vectors that returns a
**scalar**. Unlike a vector, which contains both magnitude and direction, a
scalar value has only magnitude.

The formula for dot product takes two common forms:

@Image(source: "vector_dot1.png")

and

@Image(source: "vector_dot2.png")

The mathematical notation ||A|| represents the magnitude of vector A, and
Ax means the x component of vector A.

However, in most cases it is easiest to use the built-in [dot()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2_method_dot.html#class-vector2_method_dot) method. Note that the order of the two vectors does not matter:

The dot product is most useful when used with unit vectors, making the first
formula reduce to just cos(θ). This means we can use the dot product to tell
us something about the angle between two vectors:

@Image(source: "vector_dot3.png")

When using unit vectors, the result will always be between -1 (180°) and
1 (0°).

### Facing

We can use this fact to detect whether an object is facing toward another
object. In the diagram below, the player P is trying to avoid the zombies
A and B. Assuming a zombie's field of view is **180°**, can they see the
player?

@Image(source: "vector_facing2.png")

The green arrows fA and fB are **unit vectors** representing the
zombie's facing direction and the blue semicircle represents its field of view.
For zombie A, we find the direction vector AP pointing to the player
using P - A and normalize it, however, Godot has a helper method to do this
called [direction_to()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2_method_direction_to.html#class-vector2_method_direction_to). If the angle
between this vector and the facing vector is less than 90°, then the zombie can
see the player.

In code it would look like this:

## Cross product

Like the dot product, the **cross product** is an operation on two vectors.
However, the result of the cross product is a vector with a direction that is
perpendicular to both. Its magnitude depends on their relative angle. If two
vectors are parallel, the result of their cross product will be a null vector.

@Image(source: "vector_cross1.png")

@Image(source: "vector_cross2.png")

The cross product is calculated like this:

With Godot, you can use the built-in [Vector3.cross()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector3_method_cross.html#class-vector3_method_cross)
method:

The cross product is not mathematically defined in 2D. The [Vector2.cross()](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2_method_cross.html#class-vector2_method_cross) method is a commonly used analog of the 3D cross
product for 2D vectors.

> Note: In the cross product, order matters. a.cross(b) does not give the
> same result as b.cross(a). The resulting vectors point in
> **opposite** directions.
>

### Calculating normals

One common use of cross products is to find the surface normal of a plane or
surface in 3D space. If we have the triangle ABC we can use vector
subtraction to find two edges AB and AC. Using the cross product,
AB × AC produces a vector perpendicular to both: the surface normal.

Here is a function to calculate a triangle's normal:

### Pointing to a target

In the dot product section above, we saw how it could be used to find the angle
between two vectors. However, in 3D, this is not enough information. We also
need to know what axis to rotate around. We can find that by calculating the
cross product of the current facing direction and the target direction. The
resulting perpendicular vector is the axis of rotation.

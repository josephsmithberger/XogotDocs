# Using CharacterBody2D/3D

## Introduction

Godot offers several collision objects to provide both collision detection
and response. Trying to decide which one to use for your project can be confusing.
You can avoid problems and simplify development if you understand how each of them
works and what their pros and cons are. In this tutorial, we'll look at the
[CharacterBody2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_characterbody2d.html#class-characterbody2d) node and show some examples
of how to use it.

> Note: While this document uses CharacterBody2D in its examples, the same

## What is a character body?

CharacterBody2D is for implementing bodies that are controlled via code.
Character bodies detect collisions with other bodies when moving, but are not affected by
engine physics properties, like gravity or friction. While this means that you
have to write some code to create their behavior, it also means you have more
precise control over how they move and react.

> Tip: A `CharacterBody2D` can be affected by gravity and other forces,
> but you must calculate the movement in code. The physics engine will
> not move a `CharacterBody2D`.

## Movement and collision

When moving a CharacterBody2D, you should not set its position property
directly. Instead, you use the move_and_collide() or move_and_slide() methods.
These methods move the body along a given vector and detect collisions.

> Warning: You should handle physics body movement in the _physics_process() callback.
>

The two movement methods serve different purposes, and later in this tutorial, you'll
see examples of how they work.

### move_and_collide

This method takes one required parameter: a [Vector2](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vector2.html#class-vector2) indicating
the body's relative movement. Typically, this is your velocity vector multiplied by the
frame timestep (delta). If the engine detects a collision anywhere along
this vector, the body will immediately stop moving. If this happens, the
method will return a [KinematicCollision2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_kinematiccollision2d.html#class-kinematiccollision2d) object.

KinematicCollision2D is an object containing data about the collision
and the colliding object. Using this data, you can calculate your collision
response.

move_and_collide is most useful when you just want to move the body and
detect collision, but don't need any automatic collision response. For example,
if you need a bullet that ricochets off a wall, you can directly change the angle
of the velocity when you detect a collision. See below for an example.

### move_and_slide

The move_and_slide() method is intended to simplify the collision
response in the common case where you want one body to slide along the other.
It is especially useful in platformers or top-down games, for example.

When calling move_and_slide(), the function uses a number of node properties
to calculate its slide behavior. These properties can be found in the Inspector,
or set in code.

- velocity - default value: Vector2( 0, 0 )

This property represents the body's velocity vector in pixels per second.
move_and_slide() will modify this value automatically when colliding.



- motion_mode - default value: MOTION_MODE_GROUNDED

This property is typically used to distinguish between side-scrolling and
top-down movement. When using the default value, you can use the is_on_floor(),
is_on_wall(), and is_on_ceiling() methods to detect what type of
surface the body is in contact with, and the body will interact with slopes.
When using MOTION_MODE_FLOATING, all collisions will be considered "walls".



- up_direction - default value: Vector2( 0, -1 )

This property allows you to define what surfaces the engine should consider
being the floor. Its value lets you use the is_on_floor(), is_on_wall(),
and is_on_ceiling() methods to detect what type of surface the body is
in contact with. The default value means that the top side of horizontal surfaces
will be considered "ground".



- floor_stop_on_slope - default value: true

This parameter prevents a body from sliding down slopes when standing still.



- wall_min_slide_angle - default value: 0.261799 (in radians, equivalent to 15 degrees)

This is the minimum angle where the body is allowed to slide when it hits a
slope.



- floor_max_angle - default value: 0.785398 (in radians, equivalent to 45 degrees)

This parameter is the maximum angle before a surface is no longer considered a "floor."



This property represents the body's velocity vector in pixels per second.
move_and_slide() will modify this value automatically when colliding.

This property is typically used to distinguish between side-scrolling and
top-down movement. When using the default value, you can use the is_on_floor(),
is_on_wall(), and is_on_ceiling() methods to detect what type of
surface the body is in contact with, and the body will interact with slopes.
When using MOTION_MODE_FLOATING, all collisions will be considered "walls".

This property allows you to define what surfaces the engine should consider
being the floor. Its value lets you use the is_on_floor(), is_on_wall(),
and is_on_ceiling() methods to detect what type of surface the body is
in contact with. The default value means that the top side of horizontal surfaces
will be considered "ground".

This parameter prevents a body from sliding down slopes when standing still.

This is the minimum angle where the body is allowed to slide when it hits a
slope.

This parameter is the maximum angle before a surface is no longer considered a "floor."

There are many other properties that can be used to modify the body's behavior under
specific circumstances. See the [CharacterBody2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_characterbody2d.html#class-characterbody2d) docs
for full details.

## Detecting collisions

When using move_and_collide() the function returns a KinematicCollision2D
directly, and you can use this in your code.

When using move_and_slide() it's possible to have multiple collisions occur,
as the slide response is calculated. To process these collisions, use get_slide_collision_count()
and get_slide_collision():

> Note: `get_slide_collision_count()` only counts times the body has collided and changed direction.
>

See [KinematicCollision2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_kinematiccollision2d.html#class-kinematiccollision2d) for details on what
collision data is returned.

## Which movement method to use?

A common question from new Godot users is: "How do you decide which movement
function to use?" Often, the response is to use move_and_slide() because
it seems simpler, but this is not necessarily the case. One way to think of it
is that move_and_slide() is a special case, and move_and_collide()
is more general. For example, the following two code snippets result in
the same collision response:

@Image(source: "k2d_compare.gif")

Anything you do with move_and_slide() can also be done with move_and_collide(),
but it might take a little more code. However, as we'll see in the examples below,
there are cases where move_and_slide() doesn't provide the response you want.

In the example above, move_and_slide() automatically alters the velocity
variable. This is because when the character collides with the environment,
the function recalculates the speed internally to reflect
the slowdown.

For example, if your character fell on the floor, you don't want it to
accumulate vertical speed due to the effect of gravity. Instead, you want its
vertical speed to reset to zero.

move_and_slide() may also recalculate the kinematic body's velocity several
times in a loop as, to produce a smooth motion, it moves the character and
collides up to five times by default. At the end of the process, the character's
new velocity is available for use on the next frame.

## Examples

To see these examples in action, download the sample project:
character_body_2d_starter.zip

### Movement and walls

If you've downloaded the sample project, this example is in "basic_movement.tscn".

For this example, add a CharacterBody2D with two children: a Sprite2D and a
CollisionShape2D. Use the Godot "icon.svg" as the Sprite2D's texture (drag it
from the Filesystem dock to the Texture property of the Sprite2D). In the
CollisionShape2D's Shape property, select "New RectangleShape2D" and
size the rectangle to fit over the sprite image.

> Note: See <doc:2d_movement> for examples of implementing 2D movement schemes.
>

Attach a script to the CharacterBody2D and add the following code:

Run this scene and you'll see that move_and_collide() works as expected, moving
the body along the velocity vector. Now let's see what happens when you add
some obstacles. Add a [StaticBody2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_staticbody2d.html#class-staticbody2d) with a
rectangular collision shape. For visibility, you can use a Sprite2D, a
Polygon2D, or turn on "Visible Collision Shapes" from the "Debug" menu.

Run the scene again and try moving into the obstacle. You'll see that the CharacterBody2D
can't penetrate the obstacle. However, try moving into the obstacle at an angle and
you'll find that the obstacle acts like glue - it feels like the body gets stuck.

This happens because there is no collision response. move_and_collide() stops
the body's movement when a collision occurs. We need to code whatever response we
want from the collision.

Try changing the function to move_and_slide() and running again.

move_and_slide() provides a default collision response of sliding the body along the
collision object. This is useful for a great many game types, and may be all you need
to get the behavior you want.

### Bouncing/reflecting

What if you don't want a sliding collision response? For this example ("bounce_and_collide.tscn"
in the sample project), we have a character shooting bullets and we want the bullets to
bounce off the walls.

This example uses three scenes. The main scene contains the Player and Walls.
The Bullet and Wall are separate scenes so that they can be instanced.

The Player is controlled by the w and s keys for forward and back. Aiming
uses the mouse pointer. Here is the code for the Player, using move_and_slide():

And the code for the Bullet:

The action happens in _physics_process(). After using move_and_collide(), if a
collision occurs, a KinematicCollision2D object is returned (otherwise, the return
is null).

If there is a returned collision, we use the normal of the collision to reflect
the bullet's velocity with the Vector2.bounce() method.

If the colliding object (collider) has a hit method,
we also call it. In the example project, we've added a flashing color effect to
the Wall to demonstrate this.

### Platformer movement

Let's try one more popular example: the 2D platformer. move_and_slide()
is ideal for quickly getting a functional character controller up and running.
If you've downloaded the sample project, you can find this in "platformer.tscn".

For this example, we'll assume you have a level made of one or more StaticBody2D
objects. They can be any shape and size. In the sample project, we're using
[Polygon2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_polygon2d.html#class-polygon2d) to create the platform shapes.

Here's the code for the player body:

@Image(source: "k2d_platform.gif")

In this code we're using move_and_slide() as described above - to move the body
along its velocity vector, sliding along any collision surfaces such as the ground
or a platform. We're also using is_on_floor() to check if a jump should be
allowed. Without this, you'd be able to "jump" in midair; great if you're making
Flappy Bird, but not for a platformer game.

There is a lot more that goes into a complete platformer character: acceleration,
double-jumps, coyote-time, and many more. The code above is just a starting point.
You can use it as a base to expand into whatever movement behavior you need for
your own projects.

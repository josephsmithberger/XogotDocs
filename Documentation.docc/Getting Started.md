# Getting Started

Welcome to **Xogot**, a complete game development environment that runs on your iPad! Xogot is built on the popular **Godot** engine and offers a native iPad experience optimized for touch. This guide will help you dive into game development with Xogot and get comfortable with its core features.

## 1. Finding and Running Sample Projects

Xogot comes preloaded with sample projects to help you explore and learn its features quickly. To access and run these samples:

1. **Open Xogot and tap on the "Learning Center" tab**.
2. Browse through the list of curated sample projects. Each project includes a brief 
description to help you select the one that matches your interest.
3. To try a project out, simply tap on it and select **"Get"**. Xogot will download a 
new copy of the project ready for you to open and edit.
4. Once the project is downloaded, simply find and tap the project in Xogot's' **"Locations" tab** 
5. Press the **"Play" button** at the top of the interface to test the project in action.

## 2. Importing Existing Projects

If you alrady have an existing Godot project you'd like to try out in Xogot, opening your own projects is simple with the Files App integration:

1. Save your project files to your iCloud Drive, or download your project to your iPad.  
  - If your project is stored in GitHub, you can download your project as a zip directly from GitHub, or
  - Check out <doc:Working-with-Source-Control> for more detailed instructions on using 
[Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) with projects stored in Git.
2. **Open the Files App** on your iPad.
3. Navigate to the location of your existing Godot project folder.  
  - If you downloaded the project as a zip file, look for the Downloads folder under Favorites or "iCloud Drive" under Locations.  You'll need to tap the zip file to decompress the project files before you can open them in Xogot. 
4. Tap and hold the project folder, then select **"Copy"**.
5. While still in Files App, tap on **On My iPad** in the Files sidebar, and then navigate into the
**Xogot** folder.
6. Tap and hold in the empty area in the Xogot files folder and choose **"Paste"**.
7. Once imported, your project will be available in the **Project Manager** within Xogot.  
  - If Xogot was open when you imported the project, you may need to restart Xogot for the project 
to become visible 

## 3. Differences Between Xogot and Godot

While Xogot is heavily based on the Godot engine, there are some notable differences due to its adaptation for iPad:

- **User Interface**: Xogot is designed to feel native to iPadOS, with touch-friendly interface, including gestures and simplied menus with larger, easier-to-tap menu options. 
- **Support for GDScript**: Xogot only supports writing game logic using GDScript.  Projects and addons written in C#, C++, Swift, or other languages are unlikely to work in Xogot. 
- For more details, check out <doc:Differences> 

## 4. Known Issues in This Preview Release

As Xogot is currently in its preview release, there are a few known issues that you should be aware of:

- **Limited Plugins**: Certain Godot plugins may not yet be compatible with Xogot due to platform-specific constraints.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Many keyboard shortcuts available in Godot on the desktop are not currently surfaced in Xogot.
- **TBD**: Other P1 issues go here

We are actively working to resolve these issues and appreciate your patience and feedback.

# Working with Git in Xogot

Managing project files with Git

## Working Copy

To work with Godot projects stored in Git, Xogot recommends using [Working
Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com), a native iOS Git client that integrates
seamlessly with the Files App, making it an excellent tool for managing source
control on your iPad.  

To push changes and use linked folders, as detailed below, you'll need to purchase 
the Working Copy Pro unlock. 

Alternatively, users comfortable using Git from the command line can see the 
**iSH** section below for guidance on using Git with iSH.

### Cloning an Existing Project

Working Copy can clone a repository directly into Xogot’s projects area,
enabling you to use Git to manage your game source code on your iPad. Here’s how
to do it: 

1. **Open Working Copy** on your iPad.
2. Tap the **"+" button** to add a new repository.
3. Choose **"Clone Repository"** and enter the repository’s URL or use a service
   integration (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
4. **Set the destination folder**:
   - When setting the Clone repository options, tap **"Working Copy"** next to
     "Files app Location."
   - Navigate to **"On My iPad"** and select the **"Xogot"** folder as the
     destination.
5. Tap **"Clone"** to initiate the cloning process. Working Copy will create a
   linked repository within the Xogot projects folder, allowing you to commit,
   push, and fetch changes directly into Xogot.

**After Cloning**: 
- **Restart Xogot** to make the newly cloned project appear in the project
  manager:
   - Double-tap the **Home button** (or swipe up from the bottom) and swipe away
     Xogot.
   - Relaunch **Xogot** to load the cloned project.

### Setting Up a New Project in Git

If you’ve created a new project in Xogot and want to manage it with Git, or
you’ve copied a project into Xogot that was already versioned with Git, you can
add the project to Working Copy as a Linked Repository:

#### Linking a Project in Xogot to Working Copy

1. **Open Working Copy** and tap the **"+" button**.
2. Select **"Add Existing Folder"**.
3. Navigate to **"On My iPad"** and find the **"Xogot"** folder.
4. Select the folder containing your Xogot project and confirm the addition.
5. Working Copy will recognize the project and create a linked repository.

#### Adding a Remote 

If the project is not yet connected to a remote repository or you are creating a
new repository:

1. **Open the newly linked repository** in Working Copy.
2. Tap **"Add Remote"** under the Remotes section and enter the remote
   repository URL and authentication details.
3. If the folder is not already a Git repository, tap **"Create Repository"** to
   create a new repository to host the project
    - Provide a name for the repository.  The default will the be the name of
      hte linked folder
    - Choose whether the project should be Private or Public
    - Tap **Confirm Create** to finish creating the repository

Once these steps are complete, you can use **Working Copy** to manage version
control, perform commits, and push changes. Xogot will automatically reflect
file changes due to its integration with the Files App.

### Committing and Pushing Changes with Working Copy

Once you've made changes to your Xogot project, you can use **Working Copy** to
manage commits and push updates to your remote repository.

1. **Open Working Copy** and navigate to your linked repository.
2. Working Copy will automatically detect changes in the project folder.
3. To commit changes:
   - Tap on **"Commit"** to view all modified files.
   - Select the files you want to include in the commit.
   - Add a meaningful commit message.
   - Optionally, you can turn on the **Push** toggle to automatically push your
     changes.
   - Tap **"Commit"** to confirm the commit.

For more detailed instructions on using Working Copy, refer to the [official
documentation](https://workingcopyapp.com/manual/) for an in-depth guide on
committing, pushing, branching, and other Git operations.

## Using iSH to Manage Xogot Projects

For users comfortable with the command line,
[iSH](https://apps.apple.com/app/ish/id1436902243) provides an alternative way
to manage Git repositories for Xogot projects on the iPad. **iSH** is a Linux
shell emulator that allows you to run standard Unix commands, including Git,
directly on your iPad.

### Setting Up iSH for Xogot

1. **Open iSH** on your iPad.
2. Run the following command to install Git:
   ```sh
   apk add git
   ```
3. Create a mount point for your Xogot directory:
   ```sh
   mkdir /mnt/xogot
   ```
4. **Mount the Xogot directory** to the iSH filesystem:
   ```sh
   mount -t ios xogot /mnt/xogot
   ```
   When prompted, select the **Xogot folder** located under **"On My iPad"**.
   This command will mount the Xogot directory to the filesystem at the location
   `/mnt/xogot` (using the device name `xogot`).

5. **Navigate to the Xogot directory**:
   ```sh
   cd /mnt/xogot
   ```
   You are now in the Xogot directory and can run Git commands from here as you
   normally would. 
   
   For example, you can use the `git clone` command to clone a repository into
   Xogot:

   ```sh
   git clone https://some.repo/link.git
   ```

# Differences between Xogot and Godot

## Only gdscript

Xogot does not include support for C#, nor other compiled languages, including
Swift and Rust.

## Only gdscript add-ons and plugins

Xogot only support addons and plugins that are written in gdscript.  Extensions
written in C++, C#, or other compiled languages are not currently supported.

## Project Settings

In Xogot, tap the Switch button in the upper-righthand corner and choose **“Settings”**
to open Project Settings.  The individual Project Settings tabs from Godot, such as
Input Map, Autoload and Plugins, can be navigated to by tapping on the **General** in
the drop-down list at the top of the Settings dialog.

# Importing Assets

Bring sprites, textures, sounds, or 3D models into Xogot

## Get your assets into Xogot

Xogot makes it easy to import game assets directly on your iPad. Whether you're working with
**sprites, textures, sounds, or 3D models** created in other iPad apps or downloaded from the 
web (such as **TurboSquid** and other game asset repositories), this guide will help you bring 
your assets into Xogot projects smoothly.

## Save to Files App

The first step to importing files into a Xogot project is saving the asset to the **Files App**:

1. **Open the app** that contains your asset (e.g., Procreate, Safari, Uniform).
2. Tap the **“Share” icon** and choose **“Save to Files”**.
3. You can either save the asset **directly to your Xogot project folder** or save it to another well-known location, such as **“Downloads”**, for importing later.

## Importing Files from Within Xogot

Xogot provides a straightforward way to import assets through its **Files Pad**:

1. **Open Xogot** and tap on the **“Files”** icon in the sidebar.
2. Tap the **“+” button** and choose **“Import Files”**.
3. Browse through the **Files App** to locate and select the assets you saved.
4. Once imported, these files will become accessible in the Files Pad, ready for use in your game scenes.

## Drag and Drop Assets

Xogot supports **drag and drop** for importing assets, allowing for an intuitive workflow:

1. **Begin dragging the asset** in the Files App or another app that supports drag-and-drop (e.g., Photos).
2. **Switch to Xogot** by swiping up from the bottom of the screen and selecting the Xogot app while still holding the draggable item.
3. Once in Xogot, **drag the asset into the Files Pad**. Areas where the asset can be imported will show a **green “+” badge** on the asset.
4. Drop the file in the desired location, and it will be automatically added to your project.

### Running Xogot Side-By-Side with other iPad apps

1. **Open Xogot** on your iPad.
2. Tap the **three dots (“...”)** at the top of the Xogot app.
3. Select **“Split View”** from the options that appear.
4. Choose the **Files App** (or another app containing the asset) from the list of available apps to open it side-by-side with Xogot.
5. To ensure you have a target for dragging, tap the **Sow sidebar button in the upper left** of the Xogot interface and ensure that the **Files Pad** is visible.

## Importing 3D Models

Xogot natively supports **.gltf** and **.obj** file formats for importing 3D models. When importing these models, it's essential to ensure that the support files are correctly placed:

- For **gltf models**, place the corresponding **.bin** file in the same folder as the **.gltf** file.
- For **obj models**, ensure that any **textures** associated with the model are stored in a **“textures”** folder, ideally located in the same directory as the **.obj** file.

This setup will allow Xogot to properly load and display your 3D models in your projects.

### Compatible iPad Apps for Creating Assets

There are several excellent iPad apps for creating assets compatible with Xogot:

- **[Uniform](https://sparseal.com/uniform/)**: A powerful 3D modeler that makes it easy to create and export models in formats like **gltf** and **obj**.
- **Procreate**: Great for drawing and creating sprites and textures. Use the **Share** option to export images directly to Files.
- **GarageBand**: Perfect for creating and exporting sounds and background music for your game.
- **Affinity Designer/Photo**: Professional-grade vector and raster tools for creating game graphics.
- **[Nomad Sculpt](https://nomadsculpt.com)**: Sculpting and painting mobile application.

These apps, combined with Xogot’s easy importing process, can help you create high-quality game assets directly on your iPad, making the development process smoother and more enjoyable.

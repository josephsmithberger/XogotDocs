# Onscreen Controls in Xogot

Using Onscreen Controls to quickly touch-enable projects

## Onscreen Controls

Onscreen controls are crucial for testing and playing games directly on your
iPad. For projects that are not designed for touch, Xogot offers two main ways
to add onscreen controls to your project: using the **Project Setting**
(available only on iOS) or adding the **Virtual Joystick Addon**. This guide
will help you understand the differences between these methods and how to set
each up.

## How to Enable Onscreen Controls

To enable onscreen controls, you can choose between the **Project Setting Option
(iOS-only)** or the **Virtual Joystick Addon**. Each method has its own pros and
cons:

### Project Setting Option (iOS-only) vs. Virtual Joystick Addon: Pros and Cons

#### Project Setting Option (iOS-only)

**Pros**:
- Directly integrated into Xogot, offering a native experience.
- Requires minimal setup and configuration.
- Automatically adapts to game settings without any extra work in projects that
  have gamepad input mappings configured.

**Cons**:
- Limited to iOS devices.
- Customization options are more restricted compared to the Virtual Joystick
  Addon.

#### Virtual Joystick Addon

**Pros**:
- Works across all platforms where your project can run.
- Highly customizable; developers can change the appearance and behavior to suit
  game-specific needs.

**Cons**:
- Requires additional setup in your project.
- More effort to configure button mapping and visual elements.

## How to Enable Project Setting for Onscreen Controls

To use the **Project Setting Option** for onscreen controls:

1. **Open Your Project** in Xogot.
2. Tap the Switch button in the upper-righthand corner and choose
   **“Settings”**.
3. On the lefthand navigation, Find the **Input Devices** section and tap
   **“Virtual Controller”**.
4. Tap the toggle next to **“Enable Controller”** to turn the feature on.
5. Additionally, tap the toggle next to the buttons and thumbsticks that you
   want to enable or disable.  
  - Any buttons or thumbsticks that are not enabled will not be rendered
  - **Button Mapping**: Note that button names use the **Xbox naming
    convention** (e.g., "A," "B," "X," "Y"). Ensure your game actions are mapped
    appropriately to these controls for a consistent player experience.

Once these settings are saved, the onscreen controls will automatically appear
when you run your project on an iPad.  The controls will automatically hide when
your project is run on devices that have a physical controller connected.

### Configure Game Controller Input Map

The **Virtual Controller Project Setting** works by emulating hardware gamepad
actions.  If your project has **Input Map** actions configured for joypad
hardware, the virtual controls should just work.  If you have an Input Map but
have not yet configured joypad actions yet, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open Your Project** in Xogot.
2. Tap the Switch button in the upper-righthand corner and choose
   **“Settings”**.
3. Tap **General** in the drop down at the top of the dialog and select **Input
   Map**.
4. Find and select an **Input Action** in the left-hand column that you want to
   connect to a hardware action event.
5. Tap the **+** button in the upper-right corner to create a **New Input
   Event**.
6. Tap **Keyboard Keys** in the drop down at the top of the dialog and select
**Joypad Buttons** or **Joypad Axes** to locate the button or axes direction you
want to connect
  - **Button Mapping**: Note that the Virtual Controller buttons use the **Xbox
    naming convention** (e.g., "A," "B," "X," "Y").
  - **Joypad Axis**: Note that the Virtual Controller will map Joypad Axis 0 and
    1 to the Left Thumbstick, and Joypad Axis 2 and 3 map to the Right
    Thumbstick
7. When you've selected the button or axis direction you want to connect, tap
   **Create** to finish connecting the Input Action Event.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 above for each Input Action you want to map to a virtual
   controller input event.

If your project does not currently have any Input Map configured, you will first
need to add and configure Input Actions using the **+** button in the left-hand
column of the Input Map configuration screen.


## How to Add the Virtual Joystick Addon

To add the **Virtual Joystick Addon** to your project:

1. **Download the Addon**: Obtain the Virtual Joystick Addon from a trusted
   source like the official Godot Asset Library or GitHub.
2. **Add the Addon to Your Project**:
   - Open the **Files App** and locate the downloaded addon.
   - Copy the addon folder into your project’s **“addons”** directory inside the
     Xogot folder.
3. **Enable the Addon**:
   - In Xogot, tap the Switch button in the upper-righthand corner and choose
   **“Settings”**
   - Tap **General** in the drop down at the top of the dialog and select **"Plugins"**
   - Locate the **Virtual Joystick Addon** and toggle it to **“Enabled”**.
4. **Customize the Controls**: The Virtual Joystick can be customized by
   accessing the provided scripts and scenes. You can adjust the joystick
   visuals, size, and behavior to best fit your game.

After adding and configuring the Virtual Joystick, it will become available in
your game, providing a flexible and fully customizable onscreen control option.
